# GitHub User Analysis in Boston

* **Data Collection Process**: Data was collected using the GitHub API, filtering for users in Boston with over 100 followers and fetching data about their public repositories and profile information using python.
* **Key Insight**: Surprisingly, SQL repositories, though fewer, achieve the highest average star ratingsâ€”unexpectedly surpassing popular languages like JavaScript and Python. This highlights a unique appreciation for high-quality, niche SQL projects, suggesting developers find specialized SQL resources highly valuable despite the language's less prominent role in general-purpose programming.
* **Recommendation for Boston Developers**: Given the popularity of JavaScript and Python in the Boston developer community, working on collaborative projects in these languages can open up networking and partnership opportunities, especially for projects aimed at a wider audience. The low correlation between follower count and public repositories further suggests that quality matters more than quantity. Focusing on creating a few impactful, high-quality projects rather than numerous smaller ones may be a more effective strategy for building a reputation.


## Other Recommendations:
1. **Networking for Hireable Users**: Hireable users should continue expanding their networks by following other developers, which can increase their opportunities for collaboration.
2. **Enable Collaborative Tools**: Repositories with both projects and wikis tend to perform better in terms of engagement. Developers should consider enabling these features to facilitate teamwork and documentation.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into the Boston GitHub developer community's strengths and areas for growth. By focusing on Javascript and enabling collaborative tools, Boston-based developers can enhance their presence and maximize project engagement.
